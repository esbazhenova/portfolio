## About me

I am a positive-thinking person who possesses two sides of power. On one hand, I am organised, structured and attentive to details due to my background as a research chemist. And on the other, due to my personality, I love to communicate with people and solve problems.

I got my Master's Degree in University of Eastern Finland and for 3 years I was a PhD fellow in University of Jyväskylä. My research field was computational phusical chemistry which involved modelling chemical reactions by massively parallel computing.

Now I wish to exploit my research and analytical skills in software testing. Currently I am intensively studying techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications created for learning purposes.

I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge for testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal — to become a mid-level software tester in 2 years.
